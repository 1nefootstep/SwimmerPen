### Annotation Examples

#### Setting 0m
Based on race time and estimating swimmer touching wall at end of race

![setting_0m](assets/using_race_time_to_set_0m.gif)

#### Annotating distance
Using the center of lane tags

![annotating_distance_example](assets/annotating_distance.gif)

#### Annotating stroke
By using hand contact on water as reference
